                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Hello everyone! I&#39;m Luka, currently a sophomore at New York University majoring in Interactive Media Arts. I was born and raised in Hangzhou, China, and my hometown has had a profound meaning in my life. With its picturesque West Lake and rich cultural history, Hangzhou is not only a place of fond memories but also a source of constant artistic inspiration for my creative journey. It has shaped my worldview and deeply influenced my projects.</p>

                <p>One of my most meaningful works, <strong>Evolution</strong>, reflects the social dynamics of Hangzhou. This installation artwork explores the immense academic pressures on teenagers in my hometown. The term “involution” refers to a cycle of over-competition in which students are pushed to outperform one another in ways that often feel counterproductive. Through this artwork, I aim to critique this vicious cycle and visualize how endless comparisons and pressure can affect the healthy development of youth. The work incorporates elements of books, test papers, and time signatures wrapped in a chaotic but organized installation, symbolizing the overwhelming nature of the issue. It is both a personal and collective story that resonates deeply with many students from similar backgrounds.</p>

                <p>In addition to artistic pursuits, sports have played an important role in my life. In high school, basketball and American soccer were my two main passions. They brought me camaraderie, discipline, and joy, balancing the pressures of academics and creativity. Basketball is energizing and strategically deep, and I still enjoy the sport in New York. However, since moving to New York, my love of American soccer has had to be set aside due to the lack of easily accessible sports fields in New York, which has been a challenge for me.</p>

                <p>Nonetheless, living in New York has brought me new inspiration. The city&#39;s vibrant art scene, diverse culture, and fast-paced energy continue to push me to experiment and grow as an artist. It also allows me to connect my Hangzhou roots with a global perspective, creating a unique blend in my work. For example, I have been exploring how interactive technology can bridge cultural narratives, merging traditional Chinese aesthetics with modern digital media.</p>

                <p>Throughout my life&#39;s journey, I have come to realize that art and sports are more than just hobbies or passions—they are the language I use to express my identity and communicate with the world. As my studies and experiences continue to evolve, I will continue to strive to create work that not only reflects my heritage but also expresses universal themes that resonate with people from different cultures.</p>
